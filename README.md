# QuotePress-Redux

## Custom post type
The plugin creates a new custom post type called **Quotes**, with support for categories, tags, and featured images.

The plugin implements custom fields for **Quote Text** and **Author** for each quote.

## Shortcode
The plugin should also has a shortcode called `[random_quote]` to display a random quote on any page or post.

The shortcode allows customization of the quote display format, including text color, font size, and background color.

You can use these parameters for the shortcode:
* `text_color`
* `font_size`
* `background_color`

For example:
`[random_quote text_color="brown" font_size="2.5rem" background_color="#c7c2be"]`
